A Python script adapted from <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2009/11/12/how-to-make-a-us-county-thematic-map-using-free-tools/">this example</a> that shades an SVG map of Nebraska counties based on data in a csv. The data sample used here was carved out of <a href="http://electionresults.sos.ne.gov/ResultsExport.aspx?rid=702&pty=&name=For%20Governor%20and%20Lt.%20Governor&cat=CTY">an Excel file</a> of gubernatorial election results in Nebraska's 2014 general election.
